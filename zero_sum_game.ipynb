    "- **Target Cell:** The center of the grid (1,1). This is the only winning cell\n",
    "- **Simultaneous moves:** Both agent schose one of four actions [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT] at the same time\n",
    "- **Terminal condition and rewards:**\n",
    "    - The game ends when at least one agent reaches (1,1)\n",
    "    - If only one agent reaches (1,1), taht agent wins +1 and the other loses -1\n",

    "**Unique Nash Equilibrium**:\n",
    "This design (with asymmetric starting positions and a tie-breaker) guarantees that the unique Nash equilibrium is for both agents to head toword (1,1), with agent B unable to improve its outcome by deviating"
