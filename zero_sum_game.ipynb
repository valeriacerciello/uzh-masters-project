    "- **Grid Size:** 3x3 (indices 0-2)\n",
    "- **Agents:** Two agents, Agent A and Agent B\n",
    "- **Initial positions:** Agent A starts at (0,0) and Agent B at (2,2)\n",
    "- **Target Cell:** The center of the grid (1,1). This is the only winning cell\n",
    "- **Simultaneous moves:** Both agent schose one of four actions [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT] at the same time\n",
    "- **Terminal condition and rewards:**\n",
    "    - The game ends when at least one agent reaches (1,1)\n",
    "    - If only one agent reaches (1,1), taht agent wins +1 and the other loses -1\n",
    "    - If both reach (1,1) simultaneously, Agent A wins (tie-breaker)\n",
    "- **Zero-Sum:** One agent's gain is exactly the other's loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unique Nash Equilibrium**:\n",
    "This design (with asymmetric starting positions and a tie-breaker) guarantees that the unique Nash equilibrium is for both agents to head toword (1,1), with agent B unable to improve its outcome by deviating"
